This is a sample web application file for backup testing.

Created: 2026-01-30
Purpose: Demo content for the offline backup system

Sample application structure:
- index.html (main page)
- styles.css (styling)
- script.js (functionality)
- config.json (configuration)

This file will be included in all backup operations to demonstrate
the backup and recovery functionality.

Note: In a real scenario, this would be a complete web application
with multiple files, databases, and assets.
